# KNN--means-Clustering-
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised learning method used for classification and regression. 
It classifies a data point based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors (using distance metrics like Euclidean distance). I
n regression, it predicts values by averaging the target values of the nearest neighbors. KNN is simple, non-parametric, and works best with small datasets.
